# Recommender-System
Recommender systems are an integral part of many online systems. From e-commerce to online streaming platforms. Recommender systems employ the past purchase pattern 
on its user to predict which other products they may be interested in and likely to purchase. Recommending the right products gives a significant advantage to 
the business. A major portion of the revenue is generated through recommendations.The Collaborative Filtering algorithm is very popular in online streaming 
platforms and e-commerce sites where the customer interacts with each product (which can be a movie/ song or consumer products) by either liking/ disliking or 
giving a rating of sorts. One of the requirements to be able to apply collaborative filtering is that sufficient number of products need ratings associated with not them. User interaction is required.
This machine learning project walks you through the implementation of collaborative filtering using memory based technique of distance proximity using cosine distances and nearest neighbours.
